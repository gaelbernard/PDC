TODO:
Put dependencies of Python (e.g., pandas, scikit)

Note what changed with previous attempt:
 - log 4 from February was wrong on the website. The folder replay contain now the correct replaying
 - Model to improve:
 	
 	PRIORITY 2:
	model 9. Maybe I can find a model that allows for more behaviors and then restrict with DMN
	model 10. Maybe I can find a model that allows for more behaviors and then restrict with DMN
 	
 	DONE 
  	model 8: I cannot manage to find an imperative model, Declarative model seems fine. + I don't see any link with the DMN table. Approx. 35/40
